						Din Tai Fung
					</h3>
					<p class="general-text">Originally from Taiwan, Din Tai Fung is a famous chain restaurant known for its Shanghainese pork dumplings "xiao long bao" - juicy meatball in pig fat broth wrapped in a dumpling. I like their shredded pork fried rice and spicy pork dumplings too. Speedy, reliable, and consistent place for soup dumplings. </p>

						Fu Sing
					</h3>
					<p class="general-text">My all time favorite place for good quality BBQ pork. I crave their BBQ pork buns- especially when I'm abroad and thinking about what I want for my first meal back. Their piping hot BBQ buns with the perfectly crispy crust are a must! I eat at least three every time I come... Fu Sing also serves a lot of other good Chinese classics (rice, noodles, meats, seafood, veggies, etc). Get the deep freid diced tofu, soy sauce chicken, and pea shoots in soup.</p>

						Summer Palace Island Shangri-La
					</h3>
					<p class="general-text">Delicious Cantonese cuisine with two Michelin stars. Totally worth the treat! The barbecued suckling pig is a classic. Great for dimsum as well- love the rice rolls ("cheung fun") with crispy shrimp inside. Don't forget to save room for dessert! </p>

						On Lee Noodles
					</h3>
					<p class="general-text">Come for a bowl of hearty Hong Kong noodles. Though it is on the other side of Hong Kong island (not a touristy area), this is the place I would suggest if you want to try what locals eat. Get the fishball noodles "ho fun" and beef brisket noodles. For something sweet if you're still hungry after, try the HK-style French toast.</p>
