            <p>Born and raised in Hong Kong, Flora now studies Computer Science at Tufts University in Boston. Though not exactly sure what she wants to for a career, she hopes to work on the technology side of things for an environmental non-profit after graduating. In her free time, Flora enjoys taking long naps, indulging in desserts, and running outdoors. Her favorite ice cream flavor is mint chocolate chip.</p>
